# musixmatchR
Wrapper written in R for getting metadata about songs, bands, artists and lyrics from Musixmatch.

## Getting Started

This package allows you to get data from MusixMatch database. I started using the API to access band's lyrics and I thought it would be a great opportunity to share it with other people that have the same needs =)


### Prerequisites

First things first: To use the package without difficulty, it is important that you create an application to provide you with an API Key from MusixMatch. 
An easy way to do so is accessing [MusixMatch Developers Page](https://developer.musixmatch.com/admin/applications) . After you create an application, a Key will be provided to you. 
This key is very important for you to be able to access all features on the package.

### Installing
To get **musixmatchR** running, you have to use **devtools** since it is not available on CRAN yet.

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("fernandabruno/musixmatchR")
library(musixmatchR)
```
To make the package simpler to use, it is important that you create an object called *apikey* to store your API Key and to use it as a parameter as you call the functions.
For example:

```r
apikey<-"YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Accessing data
With your created api key, you are ready to access all the functionalities provided by musixmatchR package. 
Let's give it a try.

### Getting data about Artists or Bands

It searches Musixmatch database for a provided band, singer or artist.

```r

#Cool Examples

A simple and cool example is creating a Word Cloud based on the most used words from a singer. 
I created a Comparison Cloud based on words that are present on the early Taylor Swift phase (until *1989* album) and her new phase (*Reputation*).

Another cool approach is combining data from MusixMatch and Spotify API. What about checking if the old Taylor is dead?
Let's use valence measure to get the answer. Valence describes whether something is likely to make someone feel happy or sad. So... What about new Taylor Swift's songs? Using valence metadata from Taylor songs, it looks like the old Taylor is, in fact, dead. Or isn't she?
